# EHR_Sepsis_Project
This repository contains an end-to-end analysis of severe sepsis patients using the MIMIC-III database. The project focuses on cohort selection, data extraction, cleaning, and exploratory and statistical analysis to compare clinical, laboratory, and treatment factors between survivors and non-survivors.
